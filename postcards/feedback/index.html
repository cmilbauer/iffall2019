	<ul>
		<li> For first card, smooth the black fade overaly so that it's rounded around the image </li>
		<li> For third card, I think some of the other options are better because they don't have different information between the two cards </li>
		<li> Interesting how you use image and text as two elements on top of card. This makes it easier to move them in relation to eachother to create optimal arrangement </li>
		<li> It's nice when it says who is saying the quote </li>

		<li> This is a required course for my major. However, I am also a computer science minor and am very interested in interaction design as the intersection between design and coding, or as a way to use coding to create design elements. </li>
		<li> I do not have experience with any of the listed languages.</li>
		<li> hope to learn how to design webpages that will engage users, and be able to work from the perspective of the needs and thought process of the user.</li>
		<li> I expect designing for a screen to be more interactive and require more flexiblilty. On print, the elements of the design are really locked into place and there is more control over the users' interaction with the piece. When designing for the screen it will be important to take into consideration how the user will navigate the space, as well as how the piece will fit on screens of different sizes. Additionally, because of the nature of coding, there may be more of a trial and error process as opposed to an iterative process. </li>

		<li>  <a href="https://www.franshalsmuseum.nl/en/"> Frans Hals Museum </a> I liked the design of this website because it is very eye-catching and immediately draws the user in. While there is a lot of interaction possible on the home page, it is not overwhelming. The information is relevant and there is clear hierarchy. </li>
		<li> <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/"> Nasa's Climate Change </a> I think that this website communicates very clearly. It is very informative and has clear definitiosn and labels</li>
		<li> <a href="http://theglasshouse.org/"> The Glass House </a> This website is extremely clean. The hierachy and navigation are clear. It is also very aesthetically pleasing and makes good use of relevant and appealing photographs, especially in the "explore" section. </li>

<strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
He was a boy, she was a girl <br>
Can I make it any more obvious?<br>
He was a punk, she did ballet<br>
What more can I say?<br>
He wanted her, she'd never tell<br>
Secretly she wanted him as well<br>
But all of her friends stuck up their nose<br>
They had a problem with his baggy clothes<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
He was a sk8er boi, she said, "See you later, boy"<br>
He wasn't good enough for her<br>
She had a pretty face, but her head was up in space<br>
She needed to come back down to earth<br>
<br>
<strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
Five years from now, she sits at home<br>
Feeding the baby, she's all alone<br>
She turns on TV, guess who she sees<br>
Sk8er boi rocking up MTV<br>
She calls up her friends, they already know<br>
And they've all got tickets to see his show<br>
She tags along, stands in the crowd<br>
Looks up at the man that she turned down<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
He was a sk8er boi, she said, "See you later, boy"<br>
He wasn't good enough for her<br>
Now he's a superstar, slammin' on his guitar<br>
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?<br>
He was a sk8er boi, she said, “See you later, boy”<br>
He wasn't good enough for her<br>
Now he's a superstar, slammin' on his guitar<br>
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?<br>
<br>
<strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
Sorry, girl, but you missed out<br>
Well, tough luck, that boy's mine now<br>
We are more than just good friends<br>
This is how the story ends<br>
Too bad that you couldn't see<br>
See the man that boy could be<br>
There is more than meets the eye<br>
I see the soul that is inside<br>
<br>
<strong>[Breakdown]</strong><br>
He's just a boy and I'm just a girl<br>
Can I make it any more obvious?<br>
We are in love, haven't you heard<br>
How we rock each other's world?<br>
<br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
I'm with the sk8er boi,<br>
I said, "See you later, boy"<br>
I'll be backstage after the show<br>
I'll be at a studio<br>
Singing the song we wrote<br>
About a girl you used to know<br>
I'm with the sk8er boi<br>
I said, "See you later, boy"<br>
I'll be backstage after the show<br>
I'll be at a studio<br>
Singing the song we wrote<br>
About a girl you used to know<br>

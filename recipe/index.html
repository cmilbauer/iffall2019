		<h3></h3>
		<h1> Ingredients </h1>
		<div> 2 large Russet potatoes (about 1 pound), scrubbed and cut lengthwise into quarters </div>
		<div> 1 large onion (8 ounces), peeled and cut into quarters </div>
		<div> 2 large eggs </div>
		<div> 1/2 cup all-purpose flour </div>
		<div> 2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt (or 1 teaspoon fine sea salt), plus more for sprinkling </div>
		<div> 1 teaspoon baking powder </div>
		<div> 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper </div>
		<div> Safflower or other oil, for frying </div>
		<h1> Instructions </h1>
		<h2> STEP 1 </h2>
		<div> Using a food processor with a coarse grating disc, grate the potatoes and onion. Transfer the mixture to a clean dishtowel and squeeze and wring out as much of the liquid as possible. </div>
		<h2> STEP 2 </h2>
		<div> Working quickly, transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Add the eggs, flour, salt, baking powder and pepper, and mix until the flour is absorbed. </div>
		<h2> STEP 3 </h2>
		<div> In a medium heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat, pour in about 1/4 inch of the oil. Once the oil is hot (a drop of batter placed in the pan should sizzle), use a heaping tablespoon to drop the batter into the hot pan, cooking in batches. </div>
		<h2> STEP 4 </h2>
		<div> Use a spatula to flatten and shape the drops into discs. When the edges of the latkes are brown and crispy, about 5 minutes, flip. Cook until the second side is deeply browned, about another 5 minutes. </div>
		<h2> STEP 5 </h2>
		<div> Transfer the latkes to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and sprinkle with salt while still warm. Repeat with the remaining batter. </div>

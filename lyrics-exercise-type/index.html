	He was a boy, she was a girl <br>
	Can I make it any more obvious?<br>
	He was a punk, she did ballet<br>
	What more can I say?<br>
	He wanted her, she'd never tell<br>
	Secretly she wanted him as well<br>
	But all of her friends stuck up their nose<br>
	They had a problem with his baggy clothes<br>
</p>
<br>
<div> <p1 class = "title">[Chorus]</p1><br>
	He was a sk8er boi, she said, "See you later, boy"<br>
	He wasn't good enough for her<br>
	She had a pretty face, but her head was up in space<br>
	She needed to come back down to earth<br>
</div>
<br>
<p> <p1 class = "title">[Verse 2]</p1><br>
	Five years from now, she sits at home<br>
	Feeding the baby, she's all alone<br>
	She turns on TV, guess who she sees<br>
	Sk8er boi rocking up MTV<br>
	She calls up her friends, they already know<br>
	And they've all got tickets to see his show<br>
	She tags along, stands in the crowd<br>
	Looks up at the man that she turned down<br>
	<br>
</p>
<div> <p1 class = "title">[Chorus]</p1><br>
	He was a sk8er boi, she said, "See you later, boy"<br>
	He wasn't good enough for her<br>
	Now he's a superstar, slammin' on his guitar<br>
	Does your pretty face see what he's worth?<br>
	He was a sk8er boi, she said, “See you later, boy”<br>
	He wasn't good enough for her<br>
	Now he's a superstar, slammin' on his guitar<br>
	Does your pretty face see what he's worth?<br>
	<br>

<p1 class = "title">[Bridge]</p1><br>	
Sorry, girl, but you missed out<br>
Well, tough luck, that boy's mine now<br>
We are more than just good friends<br>
This is how the story ends<br>
Too bad that you couldn't see<br>
See the man that boy could be<br>
There is more than meets the eye<br>
I see the soul that is inside<br>
<br>
<p1 class = "title">[Breakdown]</p1><br>
He's just a boy and I'm just a girl<br>
Can I make it any more obvious?<br>
We are in love, haven't you heard<br>
How we rock each other's world?<br>
<br>
<div> <p1 class = "title">[Chorus]</p1><br>
	I'm with the sk8er boi,<br>
	I said, "See you later, boy"<br>
	I'll be backstage after the show<br>
	I'll be at a studio<br>
	Singing the song we wrote<br>
	About a girl you used to know<br>
	I'm with the sk8er boi<br>
	I said, "See you later, boy"<br>
	I'll be backstage after the show<br>
	I'll be at a studio<br>
	Singing the song we wrote<br>
	About a girl you used to know<br>
